            possible
            regarding some popular objects of interest: Restaurants, Albums and Movies. This website allows its visitors
            to create forms and also fill in forms that describe any existing subject that is included in one of the
            previously
            mentioned category. Moreover, it is also possible to create statistics and see their results, according to
            certain aspects, such as customer preferences based on age groups, nationality and so on.
